Kernel library


This library uses some kernel files to offer basic kernel datastructures and
routines for userspace projects. To use it, just include it into your build
process, and call 'make'. This will generate an klib.o and libklib.a file.

LICENSE

Most files are from the Linux kernel sources. So klib is licensed as GPLv2.


CONTRIBUTION

If you have some kernel routines you would like to see in klib for your
userspace projects, or you need a newer version of some functions, please
create a merge request.
